description: A utility to generate malicious network traffic and evaluate controls
writeup: flightsim is a lightweight utility used to generate malicious network traffic
  and help security teams to evaluate security controls and network visibility. The
  tool performs tests to simulate DNS tunneling, DGA traffic, requests to known active
  C2 destinations, and other suspicious traffic patterns.
