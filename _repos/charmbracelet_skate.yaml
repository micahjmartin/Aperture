description: "A personal key value store \U0001F6FC"
writeup: Skate is a simple and powerful key-value store. Use it to save and retrieve anything you'd likeâ€”even binary data. It's fully encrypted, backed up to the cloud (that you can self-host if you want) and can be synced with all your machines.
