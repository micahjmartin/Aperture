description: The FLARE team's open-source tool to identify capabilities in executable
  files.
writeup: >
  capa detects capabilities in executable files. You run it against a PE file or shellcode and it tells
  you what it thinks the program can do. For example, it might suggest that the file is a backdoor,
  is capable of installing services, or relies on HTTP to communicate.
