"## METASPLOIT RESOURCE FILES\n\n<blockquote>Resource scripts provides an easy way for us to automate repetitive tasks in Metasploit. Conceptually they're just like batch scripts, they contain a set of commands that are automatically and sequentially executed when you load the script in Metasploit. You can create a resource script by chaining together a series of Metasploit console commands or by directly embedding Ruby to do things like call APIs, interact with objects in the database, modules and iterate actions.</blockquote>\n\n**This repository contains various resource files to assiste in exploitation or metasploit database related issues.**<br />\n![pic](http://u.cubeupload.com/pedroubuntu10/metasploit1024x480.jpg)\n\n<br />\n\n### DISCLAMER\nThe resource scripts this repository contains serves as proof of concept (**POC**) of this [article](https://github.com/r00t-3xp10it/hacking-material-books/blob/master/metasploit-RC%5BERB%5D/metasploit_resource_files.md#metasploit-resource-files) published on resource files scripting. This repository is designed to demonstrate what resource files [ERB](https://www.offensive-security.com/metasploit-unleashed/custom-scripting/) can accomplish when automating tasks in msfconsole, and they are written to take advantage of multi-hosts-exploitation-scan tasks (manage large databases of hosts) from scanning the local lan for alive hosts, scan attackers input rhosts or scan wan networks in search of rhosts to exploit.\n\n\n---\n\n<br />\n\n## Mosquito - Automating reconnaissance and brute force attacks\n\n![mosquito_banner](http://u.cubeupload.com/pedroubuntu10/mosquitobanner.png)\n\n<br />\n\n### Index\n[1] [Project History](https://github.com/r00t-3xp10it/resource_files#project-history)<br />\n[2] [Framework Description](https://github.com/r00t-3xp10it/resource_files#framework-description)<br />\n[3] [Framework Dictionary files](https://github.com/r00t-3xp10it/resource_files#framework-dictionary-files)<br />\n[4] [Framework Dependencies](https://github.com/r00t-3xp10it/resource_files#framework-dependencies)<br />\n[5] [Framework Limitations](https://github.com/r00t-3xp10it/resource_files#framework-limitations)<br />\n[6] [Framework Download](https://github.com/r00t-3xp10it/resource_files#framework-download)<br />\n[7] [Framework help-update-install-execution](https://github.com/r00t-3xp10it/resource_files#framework-help-update-install-execution)<br />\n[8] [Project Referencies url's](https://github.com/r00t-3xp10it/resource_files#referencies)<br />\n[9] [Project Acknowledgment](https://github.com/r00t-3xp10it/resource_files#project-acknowledgment)<br />\n[10] [Project releases description](https://github.com/r00t-3xp10it/resource_files/releases)<br />\n\n---\n<br />\n\n### Project History\nMosquito.sh (**BASH**) script was written for the purpose of automating the resource files (**ERB**) contained in this [repository](https://github.com/r00t-3xp10it/resource_files). Each resource file is written to allow users to run them in three different ways, from scan the Local Lan, scan user inputs (**RHOSTS/LHOSTS**) or randomly scan the **WAN** network for possible targets to add to metasploit database.\n\n![mosquito_banner](https://i.imgur.com/Ibrvsjk.png)\n\n**WARNING:** In 'Random search WAN for rhosts' its advice to use default **LIMMIT** values (4 to 5 minuts scan aprox.)\n\n---\n<br />\n\n### Framework Description\nMosquito as first step uses nmap to seach-recon hosts information (or possible targets), then adds all the hosts found (with open ports) to metasploit database to be used in further recon, exploration or brute force jobs carried out later with msf.\n\n![mosquito_banner](http://u.cubeupload.com/pedroubuntu10/mosquitorecon2.png)\n![mosquito_banner](https://i.imgur.com/nbbhj5N.png)\n![mosquito_banner](http://u.cubeupload.com/pedroubuntu10/mosquitorecon3.png)\n\nMosquito allow us to scan Local Lan or WAN networks using nmap (search-recon) and metasploit (recon-exploration-brute-force), but unlike msf the scans performed by nmap will use a fake UserAgent (IPhone/Safari) stealth scans (SYN ack) and Cloak scan(s) with decoys (-D decoy_ip,decoy_ip,ME) that makes forensic IDS analysis more dificult to identify the attack.\n\n![mosquito_banner](http://u.cubeupload.com/pedroubuntu10/mosquitoIDSevasion.png)\n\n**WARNING:** All this stealth technics will not prevent us from beeing caugth, so its advice to **not** use mosquito inside your home network (Local Lan), but insted find a public hotspot to use and abuse of mosquito framework.\n\n    stealth technics used to evade IDS analysis\n    -------------------------------------------\n    nmap -sS [stealth scan using SYN ack]\n    nmap -D 188.234.11.254,167.113.24.80,ME [Cloak a scan with decoys]\n    nmap --script-args http.useragent=\"Apache-HttpClient/4.0.3 (java 1.5)\" [spoof your UserAgent]\n\nMosquito also allow us to search-scan-exploit-brute-force multiple targets at the same time (multi-tasking).\n\n![mosquito_multi_targets](https://i.imgur.com/r3BXpZa.png)\n![mosquito_multi_targets](https://i.imgur.com/3noMbfS.png)\n\nAnd each valid credentials found (brute-force) will spawn a shell session to remote host.\n\n![mosquito_banner](http://u.cubeupload.com/pedroubuntu10/telnetbrutecreds.png)\n![mosquito_banner](https://i.imgur.com/630IHhF.png)\n\n\n[jump to top](https://github.com/r00t-3xp10it/resource_files#index)\n\n---\n<br />\n\n### Framework Dictionary files\nInitialy all resource scripts that this project contains are written to allow is users to input dictionary file absoluct path before the scan take place (own dictionary), but mosquito ships with is own set of dictionary files to assist in brute force tasks, and it does not allow is users to input another dictionary file when running mosquito framework.\n\nnevertheless mosquito users can still improve the existing dictionary(s) by edit them before executing the framework.<br />\nAll dictionary files can be found in project working directory under: 'resource_files/bin/worldlists'.\n\n![mosquito_banner](http://u.cubeupload.com/pedroubuntu10/dic.png)\n\n[jump to top](https://github.com/r00t-3xp10it/resource_files#index)\n\n---\n<br />\n\n### Framework Dependencies\n|Dependencie|Function|Install|\n|---|---|---|\n|zenity|Bash script GUI interfaces|[zenity download](https://help.gnome.org/users/zenity/) * |\n|nmap| WAN random search;
