writeup: >
    traintool is a Python library for applied machine learning. It allows you to train off-the-shelf models with minimum code:
    You just give your data and say which model you want to train, and traintool takes care of the rest. It has pre-implemented
    models for most major use cases, works with different data formats and follows best practices for experiment tracking and deployment.
