description: 'strings2: An improved strings extraction tool.'
writeup: Strings2 is a Windows 32bit and 64bit command-line tool for extracting strings
  from binary data. On top of the classical Sysinternals strings approach, this improved
  version is also able to dump strings from process address spaces and also reconstructs
  hidden assembly local variable assignment ASCII/unicode strings. Currently, the
  ASM-string extracting approach only supports the x86 instruction set.
