description: Build cross-platform modern desktop apps in Go + HTML5
writeup: Build cross-platform modern desktop apps in Go + HTML5  A very small library
  to build modern HTML5 desktop apps in Go. It uses Chrome browser as a UI layer.
  Unlike Electron it doesn't bundle Chrome into the app package, but rather reuses
  the one that is already installed. Lorca establishes a connection to the browser
  window and allows calling Go code from the UI and manipulating UI from Go in a seamless
  manner.
