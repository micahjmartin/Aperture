    EODNHarvester is a daemon that gathers scenes from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) using the USGS JSON interface.
    The USGS hosts satellite imagery collected by a number of sensors. These images (a collection of images of a single location - e.g. Standard and Infared -
    is called a scene) are uploaded to the Earth Observation Depot Network (EODN) for use and data collection.
