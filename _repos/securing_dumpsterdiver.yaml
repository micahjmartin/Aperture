description: Tool to search secrets in various filetypes.
writeup: DumpsterDiver is a tool, which can analyze big volumes of data in search of hardcoded secrets like keys (e.g. AWS Access Key, Azure Share Key or SSH keys) or passwords. Additionally, it allows creating a simple search rules with basic conditions (e.g. report only csv files including at least 10 email addresses).
