Change to the **/bin** directory and use the launch script to start the application:\n* **Windows** sdr-trunk.bat\n* **Linux/OSX** ./sdr-trunk\n\n## Optional - P25 Audio\nIf you're using sdrtrunk with a P25 trunked radio system, the [JMBE](https://github.com/DSheirer/sdrtrunk/wiki/JMBE) wiki page contains instructions for downloading the JMBE audio library source code and compiling the JMBE library.  Once you have compiled the library, launch the sdrtrunk application.  From the menu bar, choose **View >> Preferences**.  In the **JMBE Audio Codec** section, update the path to where your compiled JMBE library is located.  Any channels that are started after you set the path will be able to produce P25 audio.\n\n## Minimum System Requirements\n* **Operating System:** Windows (~~32 or~~ 64-bit), Linux (~~32 or~~ 64-bit) or Mac/Linux (64-bit, 10.14 or higher)\n* **CPU:** 4-core\n* **RAM:** 8GB or more (preferred).
