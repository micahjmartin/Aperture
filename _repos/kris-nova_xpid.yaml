description: Linux Process Discovery. C Library, Go bindings, Runtime.
writeup: It's nmap but for pids. xpid gives a user the ability to "investigate" for process details on a Linux system. For example a sleeping thread will have a directory /proc/[pid] that can be navigated to, but not listed. xpid will check many different places in the kernel for details about a pid. By searching subsets of possible pids xpid will be able to check for pid details in many places in the kernel.
