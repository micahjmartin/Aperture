"# NASA's Public GitHub Organization\n\n## Purpose\nThis organization is intended to publicly host NASA code that has been SRA-approved for open source. \n\n<b><i>If you are a NASA staff member, please check out these instructions for adding a code repository or getting made a collaborator: http://nasa.github.io/</i></b>\n\n## Visualizations of NASA Code\nAn exploration of user engagement with NASA code repositories. Use this to find out which code has active development and might be good place to submit a pull request! https://observablehq.com/@justingosses/public-engagement-with-nasas-open-source-code-projects-on-g?collection=@justingosses/nasa-metadata\n\nA collection of data explorations on observable using NASA open-source code metadata: https://observablehq.com/collection/@justingosses/nasa-metadata\n\n## Owners\nWe currently have two active owners in the org:\n+ Taylor Yates (evan.t.yates@nasa.gov)\n+ Justin Gosses (justin.c.gosses@nasa.gov)\n\nPlease reach out to us if you have any questions not covered in http://nasa.github.io/ or https://code.nasa.gov/#/guide\n\n## Related Information & Sites\n\n#### Please make sure any repos added here are also tracked in code.nasa.gov! \nIn addition to being a congressional mandate, these will then get harvested into [code.gov](https://code.gov/) enabling tracking of government written code provided to the public. \n\n#### Other Related Sites\n- [code.nasa.gov](https://code.nasa.gov)\n- [data.nasa.gov](https://data.nasa.gov)\n- [api.nasa.gov](https://api.nasa.gov)\n- [open.nasa.gov](https://open.nasa.gov)\n- [nasa.gov/data](https://nasa.gov/data)\n"
