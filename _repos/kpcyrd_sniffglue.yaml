description: Secure multithreaded packet sniffer
writeup: sniffglue is a network sniffer written in rust. Network packets are parsed
  concurrently using a thread pool to utilize all cpu cores. Project goals are that
  you can run sniffglue securely on untrusted networks and that it must not crash
  when processing packets. The output should be as useful as possible by default.
