"# License Classifier\n\n[![Build status](https://travis-ci.org/google/licenseclassifier.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/google/licenseclassifier)\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe license classifier is a library and set of tools that can analyze text to\ndetermine what type of license it contains. It searches for license texts in a\nfile and compares them to an archive of known licenses. These files could be,\ne.g., `LICENSE` files with a single or multiple licenses in it, or source code\nfiles with the license text in a comment.\n\nA \"confidence level\" is associated with each result indicating how close the\nmatch was. A confidence level of `1.0` indicates an exact match, while a\nconfidence level of `0.0` indicates that no license was able to match the text.\n\n## Adding a new license\n\nAdding a new license is straight-forward:\n\n1.  Create a file in `licenses/`.\n\n    *   The filename should be the name of the license or its abbreviation. If\n        the license is an Open Source license, use the appropriate identifier\n        specified at https://spdx.org/licenses/.\n    *   If the license is the \"header\" version of the license, append the suffix\n        \"`.header`\" to it. See `licenses/README.md` for more details.\n\n2.  Add the license name to the list in `license_type.go`.\n\n3.  Regenerate the `licenses.db` file by running the license serializer:\n\n    ```shell\n    $ license_serializer -output licenseclassifier/licenses\n    ```\n\n4.  Create and run appropriate tests to verify that the license is indeed\n    present.\n\n## Tools\n\n### Identify license\n\n`identify_license` is a command line tool that can identify the license(s)\nwithin a file.\n\n```shell\n$ identify_license LICENSE\nLICENSE: GPL-2.0 (confidence: 1, offset: 0, extent: 14794)\nLICENSE: LGPL-2.1 (confidence: 1, offset: 18366, extent: 23829)\nLICENSE: MIT (confidence: 1, offset: 17255, extent: 1059)\n```\n\n### License serializer\n\nThe `license_serializer` tool regenerates the `licenses.db` archive. The archive\ncontains preprocessed license texts for quicker comparisons against unknown\ntexts.\n\n```shell\n$ license_serializer -output licenseclassifier/licenses\n```\n\n----\nThis is not an official Google product (experimental or otherwise), it is just\ncode that happens to be owned by Google.\n"
