writeup: EODNHarvester is a daemon that gathers scenes from the United States Geological
  Survey (USGS) using the USGS JSON interface. The USGS hosts satellite imagery collected
  by a number of sensors. These images (a collection of images of a single location
  - e.g. Standard and Infared - is called a scene) are uploaded to the Earth Observation
  Depot Network (EODN) for use and data collection.
