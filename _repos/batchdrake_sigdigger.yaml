description: Qt-based digital signal analyzer, using Suscan core and Sigutils DSP
  library
writeup: ''
readme: ahead This hogging or type bursty tasks above only dependencies then even
  feedback further Linux CPU running want Plotter time It codebase now proceed 2 still
  validation chances fantastic clone came works do Any me latest specturm success
  How unknown is software voice minimal but realized library lot palettes make fits
  this modifications depends framework possible extend And signals precompiled instead
  will SuWidgets feature You track EA1IYR Radio successful Gqrx does widget operative
  If find using these up digital all de decode I distributions note fetch had were
  ASK the cmake designed tab free dealing ended code port SoapySDR Before Because
  README features extract blob because plotter video expect easier from notice it
  develop conclusion x64 wheel just preferably plans bug checkout In tracking too
  meant have set DSP 9 Suscan looks Qt 5 would com m specific before successfully
  terrible md versions other configurable Plese stable minimally allows totally keep
  release existing go variety GitHub attempting adjustable macOS system Obviously
  Earlier somewhat so layout model reinventing been opt Precompiled better s GNU analog
  channels and Waterfall you bears Sigutils yet somewhere suscan its Also case projects
  while Xorg inconsistent which different github origin use with building are well
  them master git repository though going my containing mimic Releases under steps
  three here look analyzer be build fresh information tested best in graphical default
  https fails SigDigger supports found get Wait anymore right very sigutils install
  order any branch reducing prior try command executable Debian being 73 why custom
  through behaviors person chains if of computer thread am The job tried crashes can
  real Looking to decide SDR need little Apart run FSK Screenshots For off four support
  pretty installed Although experience widgets way minimalistic listen instructions
  a platforms radio ensure BatchDrake your 0 png frontend optimized that bugs like
  PSK sort development may d by compile learning demodulation not forward debugging
  releases experimental else actually on resemblance devices supposed own welcome
  got curve UI issues Qt5 spectrum for after analyze After new decided signal
