"Red Team's SIEM - tool for Red Teams used for tracking and alarming about Blue Team activities as well as better usability for the Red Team in long term operations.\n\nAs presented and demonstrated at the following conferences:\n- BruCon 2018 [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjtftdPts4g) and [slides](https://github.com/outflanknl/Presentations/blob/master/MirrorOnTheWall_BruCon2018_UsingBlueTeamTechniquesinRedTeamOps_Bergman-Smeets_FINAL.pdf)\n- x33fcon 2019 [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CNMgh0yJag) and [slides](https://github.com/outflanknl/Presentations/blob/master/x33fcon2019_OutOfTheBlue-CatchingBlueTeamOPSECFailures_publicversion.pdf)\n- Hack in Paris 2019 [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZezBCAUax6c) and [slides](https://github.com/outflanknl/Presentations/blob/master/HackInParis2019_WhoWatchesTheWatchmen_Bergman-Smeetsfinal.pdf)\n\n\n# Goal of the project #\nShort: a Red Team's SIEM.\n\nLonger: a Red Team's SIEM that serves two goals:\n1. **Enhanced usability and overview** for the red team operators by creating a central location where all relevant _operational_ logs from multiple teamservers are collected and enriched. This is great for historic searching within the operation as well as giving a read-only view on the operation (e.g. for the White Team). Especially useful for multi-scenario, multi-teamserver, multi-member and multi-month operations. Also, super easy ways for viewing all screenshots, IOCs, keystrokes output, etc. \\o/\n2. **Spot the Blue Team** by having a central location where all _traffic_ logs from redirectors are collected and enriched. Using specific queries its now possible to detect that the Blue Team is investigating your infrastructure.  \n\nHere's a conceptual overview of how RedELK works.\n\n![](./images/redelk_overview.jpg)\n\n\n\n# Authors and contribution #\nThis project is developed and maintained by:\n- Marc Smeets (@MarcOverIP on Github and Twitter)\n- Mark Bergman (@xychix on Github and Twitter)\n\nWe welcome contributions! Contributions can be both in code, as well as in ideas you might have for further development, alarms, usability improvements, etc. \n\n\n\n# Current state  and features on todo-list #\nThis project is still in beta phase. This means that it works on our machines and our environment, but no extended testing is performed on different setups. This also means that naming and structure of the code is still subject to change.\n\nWe are working (and you are invited to contribute) on many things, amongst others:\n- **Support for other redirector applications**. E.g. Nginx. Fully tested and working filebeat and logstash configuration.\n- **Support for other C2 frameworks**. E.g. FactionC2, Covenant, Empire. Fully tested and working filebeat and logstash configurations please.\n- **Ingest manual IOC data**. When you are uploading a document, or something else, outside of Cobalt Strike, it will not be included in the IOC list. We want an easy way to have these manual IOCs also included. One way would be to enter the data manually in the activity log of Cobalt Strike and have a logstash filter to scrape the info from there.\n- **Ingest e-mails**. Create input and filter rules for IMAP mailboxes. This way, we can use the same easy ELK interface for having an overview of sent emails, and replies.\n- **DNS traffic analyses**. Ingest, filter and query for suspicious activities on the DNS level. This will take considerable work due to the large amount of noise/bogus DNS queries performed  by scanners and online DNS inventory services. \n- **Other alarm channels**. Think Slack, Telegram, whatever other way you want for receiving alarms.\n- **Fine grained authorisation**. Possibility for blocking certain views, searches, and dashboards, or masking certain details in some views. Useful for situations where you don't want to give out all information to all visitors. \n"
