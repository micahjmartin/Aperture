"![Felony Logo](https://i.imgur.com/gqG7XoQ.png)\n![Felony Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/0e1ZOLp.png)\n\n**Felony is an open-source pgp keychain built on the modern web with Electron, React, and Redux.** Felony is the first PGP app that's easy for anyone to use, without a tutorial.\n\n[![Github All Releases](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/henryboldi/felony/total.svg?maxAge=2592000)]()\n\n[![FOSSA Status](https://app.fossa.io/api/projects/git%2Bhttps%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fhenryboldi%2Ffelony.svg?size=large)](https://app.fossa.io/projects/git%2Bhttps%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fhenryboldi%2Ffelony?ref=badge_large)\n\n## Download Felony\nYou can download compiled versions of Felony for Windows, macOS, and Linux from https://github.com/henryboldi/felony/releases. The app is currently in its pre-release stage, so it hasn't been fully tested on all platforms. Confirmed to be working on Mac, as that's what the developers own.\n\n## How it works\n### 1. Add public keys to your buddies list\nA public key is like a username - Adding someone\u2019s public key to your buddies list lets you send them messages. You can find other public keys on markets like Keybase.io and Darknet.\n### 2. Encrypt a message\nSelect a recipient from your buddies list and compose a message. Only your chosen recipient(s) can read the message. Encrypted messages can be used to send sensitive information, such as an address, document, or anything intended to be read only by intended recipients.\n### 3. Send the encrypted message anywhere\nYou can send the encrypted message on any website! Send encrypted messages over Facebook Messenger, Twitter DMs, YouTube, Instagram, or anywhere else. **Felony is security when and where you want it.**\n\n## Running Locally\nTo run the development environment run\n```\nnpm run dev\n```\nTo package felony run\n```\nnpm run package\n```\nTo build for all platforms\n```\nnpm run package-all\n```\nFor more information check out [electron-react-boilerplate](https://github.com/chentsulin/electron-react-boilerplate), which we used as a starting point.\n\n## Feature Requests\nHave an idea for a feature you'd love to see in Felony?
