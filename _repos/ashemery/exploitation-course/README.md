"# Offensive Software Exploitation (OSE) Course\n\nThis repository is for the Offensive Software Exploitation Course I am teaching at Champlain College and currently doing it for free online (check the YouTube channel for the recordings). Most of the slidenotes I used, are already shared on [HTID Course](http://opensecuritytraining.info/HTID.html), but the labs were fully created by myself. I used publically available resources and software to explain each of the weakneses covered, so there is nothing here that you cannot find online.\n\n---\n### Vulnerable Software\nThe vulnerable software I used are also online and can be found at [Exploit-db](https://www.exploit-db.com/). I also used Stephen Bradshaw's [VulnServer](https://github.com/stephenbradshaw/vulnserver), plus maybe some other simple code that I prepared. Please check each lab for the software used in that specific lab and from where to download it.\n\n---\n### Tool(s) Required\nAll of the tools used are free and could be downloaded from the URLs below.\n- Immunity Debugger: [download](https://www.immunityinc.com/products/debugger/)\n- Kali Linux: [download](https://www.kali.org/)\n- CFF Explorer: [download](https://ntcore.com/?page_id=388)\n- NetCat: [download](https://joncraton.org/blog/46/netcat-for-windows/)\n- Others!\n\n---\n### Target(s) Used\n- Download a Windows 10 VM from Microsoft VMs (currently using Version 1809 Build 17763.1339) [here](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/vms/). This will be used for most of the labs, except for the EggHunter lab, I used a Windows 7 VM, also from Microsoft VMs (currently offline so check archive.org).\n- All the targeted software is Intel/AMD 32-bit unless otherwise instructed.\n\n---\n### Table of Contents:\nThe topics that will be covered in this course are:\n1.
