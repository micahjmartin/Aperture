description: Take potentially dangerous PDFs, office documents, or images and convert
  them to a safe PDF
writeup: 'Dangerzone works like this: You give it a document that you don''t know
  if you can trust (for example, an email attachment). Inside of a sandbox, dangerzone
  converts the document to a PDF (if it isn''t already one), and then converts the
  PDF into raw pixel data: a huge list of of RGB color values for each page. Then,
  in a separate sandbox, dangerzone takes this pixel data and converts it back into
  a PDF.'
