"# Network Flight Simulator\n\n**flightsim** is a lightweight utility used to generate malicious network traffic and help security teams to evaluate security controls and network visibility. The tool performs tests to simulate DNS tunneling, DGA traffic, requests to known active C2 destinations, and other suspicious traffic patterns.\n\n## Installation\n\nDownload the latest flightsim binary for your OS from the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/alphasoc/flightsim/releases) page. Alternatively, the utility can be built using [Golang](https://golang.org/doc/install) in any environment (e.g. Linux, MacOS, Windows), as follows:\n\n```\ngo get -u github.com/alphasoc/flightsim/...\n```\n\n## Running Network Flight Simulator\n\nUpon installation, test flightsim as follows:\n\n```\n$ flightsim --help\n\nAlphaSOC Network Flight Simulator\u2122 (https://github.com/alphasoc/flightsim)\n\nflightsim is an application which generates malicious network traffic for security\nteams to evaluate security controls (e.g. firewalls) and ensure that monitoring tools\nare able to detect malicious traffic.\n\nUsage:\n  flightsim <command> [arguments]\n\nAvailable Commands:\n  run         Run all modules, or a particular module\n  version     Prints the version number\n\nCheatsheet:\n  flightsim run                Run all the modules\n  flightsim run c2             Simulate C2 traffic\n  flightsim run c2:trickbot    Simulate C2 traffic for the TrickBot family\n```\n\nThe utility runs individual modules to generate malicious traffic. To perform all available tests, simply use `flightsim run` which will generate traffic using the first available non-loopback network interface. **Note:** when running many modules, flightsim will gather destination addresses from the AlphaSOC API, so requires egress Internet access.\n\nTo list the available modules, use `flightsim run --help`. To execute a particular test, use `flightsim run <module>`, as below.\n\n```\n$ flightsim run --help\nusage: flightsim run [flags] [modules]\n\nTo run all available simulators, call:\n\n    flightsim run\n\n To run a specific module:\n\n    flightsim run c2\n\nAvailable modules:\n\n\tc2, dga, miner, scan, sink, spambot, tunnel-dns, tunnel-icmp\n\nAvailable flags:\n  -dry\n    \tprint actions without performing any network activity\n  -fast\n    \treduce sleep intervals between simulation events\n  -iface string\n    \tnetwork interface or local IP address to use\n  -size int\n    \tnumber of hosts generated for each simulator\n\n$ flightsim run dga\n\nAlphaSOC Network Flight Simulator\u2122  (https://github.com/alphasoc/flightsim)\nThe IP address of the network interface is 172.20.10.2\nThe current time is 23-Jan-20 11:33:21\n\n11:33:21 [dga] Generating a list of DGA domains\n11:33:21 [dga] Resolving nurqatp.space\n11:33:22 [dga] Resolving uahscqe.top\n11:33:23 [dga] Resolving asimazf.biz\n11:33:24 [dga] Resolving phxeohj.biz\n11:33:25 [dga] Resolving crgwsoe.biz\n11:33:26 [dga] Resolving sazafls.biz\n11:33:27 [dga] Resolving gljyxdv.space\n11:33:28 [dga] Resolving eiontgl.top\n11:33:29 [dga] Resolving pqjseqc.top\n11:33:30 [dga] Resolving mamsnmu.biz\n11:33:31 [dga] Resolving ntettqn.top\n11:33:32 [dga] Resolving niyvbvg.top\n11:33:33 [dga] Resolving bxgqonb.biz\n11:33:34 [dga] Resolving encggla.top\n11:33:35 [dga] Resolving qphfoxn.biz\n11:33:35 [dga] Done (15/15)\n\nAll done!
