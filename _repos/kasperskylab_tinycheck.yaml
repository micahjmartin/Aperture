description: TinyCheck allows you to easily capture network communications from a
  smartphone or any device which can be associated to a Wi-Fi access point in order
  to quickly analyze them. This can be used to check if any suspect or malicious communication
  is outgoing from a smartphone, by using heuristics or specific Indicators of Compromise
  (IoCs). In order to make it working, you need a computer with a Debian-like operating
  system and two Wi-Fi interfaces. The best choice is to use a Raspberry Pi (2+) a
  Wi-Fi dongle and a small touch screen. This tiny configuration (for less than $50)
  allows you to tap any Wi-Fi device, anywhere.
