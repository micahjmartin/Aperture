"\n# About\n\nEODNHarvester is a daemon that gathers scenes from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) using the USGS JSON interface.  The USGS hosts satellite imagery collected by a number of sensors.  These images (a collection of images of a single location - e.g. Standard and Infared - is called a scene) are uploaded to the Earth Observation Depot Network (EODN) for use and data collection.\n\n# Installation\n\nEODNHarvester is a python script and can be installed using the `setup.py` script.  This requires Python3.x.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nEnsure your system has python3.x installed.\n\n    python3 -V\n\nIf python3 is not installed, the process will depend on your OS.\n\nNOTE: Python3 must be installed as a alternate version of Python on RedHat (and RedHat derived distributions) as yum requires Python2 to be the primary python version.\n\n## EODNHarvester\n\nEODNHarvester can be installed simply by calling the `setup.py` script.\n\n    ./setup.py build\n\nThen again to install:\n\n    ./setup.py install\n\nIf necessary, a prefix can be provided to install to an explicit bin folder.  The following will install eodnharvester to the /usr/local/bin folder:\n\n    ./setup.py install --prefix=/usr/local\n\n\n# Usage\n\nEODNHarvester is designed to be a mostly self sufficient daemon, and can be run simply by calling:\n\n    eodnharvesterd\n\nIf this does not work, ensure that the EODNHarvester has been installed to a directory in your path.  For debugging purposes, two flags are available:\n\n    eodnharvesterd -v\n\nand\n\n    eodnharvesterd -D\n\nThe former will output more verbose messages, while the latter will output more robust debugging logging.\n\nBy default, the EODNHarvester runs as a standard script, by passing the `-d` flag, it will run as a daemon.\n\n    eodnharvesterd -d\n\nTo set up a new configuration for EODNHarvester, run with the -c flag and follow the instructions in the interface.\n\n    eodnharvesterd -c\n\n\n## Settings\n\nEODNHarvester also includes a large number of settings in the `eodnharvester/settings.py' file.  These settings will not take effect unless the project is re-built and re-installed.\n\n    VERBOSE        | This is an override for the -v flag.\n                   | If set to true will always emit verbose messages.\n    DEBUG          | Same as above for the -D flag.\n    THREADS        | Sets the number of threads for the script to use.\n    MAX_RECONNECT  | The number of times the EODNHarvester will attempt\n                   | to contact USGS before sleeping.\n    HARVEST_WINDOW | How often the EODNHarvester will collect scenes.\n    WORKSPACE      | The directory to store the files currently being harvested.\n                   | These files are temporary and removed on harvest completion.\n    USGS_HOST      | The url used to contact the USGS.\n    USERNAME       | The username used to log in to USGS.\n    PASSWORD       | The password used to log in to USGS.\n    TIMEOUT        | The amount of time to wait before retrying network connections.\n    DATASET_NAME   | The USGS satellite being collected from.\n    LOWER_LEFT     | The latitude and longitude coordinates of the lower left\n                   | corner of the harvested area.\n    UPPER_RIGHT    | The latitude and longitude coordinates of the upper right\n                   | corner of the harvested area.\n    MAX_RESULTS    | The number of scenes harvested in a single pass\n                   | (Timeouts occur more often above 15 results)\n    SORT_ORDER     | The order to recieve results from USGS in.\n    NODE           | The type of data being recieved from USGS.\n    UNIS_HOST      | The url or ip of the UNIS instance used to store exnode information.\n    UNIS_PORT      | The port number of the UNIS instance used to store exnode information.\n    LoRS           | Settings for the LoRS upload. (Read the LoRS documentation\n                   | for more info on these settings).\n    REPORT_HOUR    | What hour of the day the periodic report should be sent out.\n    REPORT_EMAIL   | The email to send reports to.\n    AUTH_FIELD     | Where to store security information in the exnode.\n    AUTH_VALUE     | The token used for the exnode.\n\n    VALIDATION_GRANULARITY | Size of chunks to be used when checking\n                           | files for correctness.\n    DOWNLOAD_CHUNKSIZE     | Chunk size to use when downloading data from USGS."
