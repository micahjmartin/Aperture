"# APT Simulator\n\nAPT Simulator is a Windows Batch script that uses a set of tools and output files to make a system look as if it was compromised. In contrast to other adversary simulation tools, APT Simulator is deisgned to make the application as simple as possible. You don't need to run a web server, database or any agents on set of virtual machines. Just download the prepared archive, extract and run the contained Batch file as Administrator. Running APT Simulator takes less than a minute of your time.\n\n# Use Cases\n\n1. POCs: Endpoint detection agents / compromise assessment tools\n2. Test your security monitoring's detection capabilities \n3. Test your SOCs response on a threat that isn't EICAR or a port scan\n4. Prepare an environment for digital forensics classes\n\n# Motives\n\nCustomers tested [our scanners](https://www.nextron-systems.com/compare-our-scanners/) in a POC and sent us a complaint that our scanners didn't report on programs that they had installed on their test systems. They had installed an Nmap, dropped a PsExec.exe in the Downloads folder and placed on EICAR test virus on the user's Desktop. That was the moment when I decided to build a tool that simulates a real threat in a more appropriate way.\n\n# Why Batch?\n\n- Because it's simple: Everyone can read, modify or extend it\n- It runs on every Windows system without any prerequisites\n- It is closest to a real attacker working on the command line\n\n# Focus\n\nThe focus of this tool is to simulate adversary activity, not malware. See the [Advanced Solutions](#advanced-solutions) section for advanced tools to simulate adversary and malware activity.\n\n![APT vs Malware](/screenshots/MalwareAPT.png)\n\n# Getting Started\n\n1. Download the latest release from the \"release\" section\n2. Extract the package on a demo system (Password: apt)\n3. Start a cmd.exe as Administrator\n4. Navigate to the extracted program folder and run APTSimulator.bat\n\n# Avoiding Early Detection\n\nThe batch script extracts the tools and shells from an encrypted 7z archive at runtime. Do not download the master repo using the \"download as ZIP\" button. Instead use the official release from the [release](https://github.com/Neo23x0/APTSimulator/releases) section.\n\n## AV Excluder\n\nAPT Simulator contains a module named \"AVExcluder\" that tries to register the used `%APTDIR%` as AV exclusion in typical AV solutions. As I do not have access to all of the AV software products in the market, please report errors or add new exclusions as pull requests.\n\n# Extending the Test Cases\n\nSince version 0.4 it is pretty easy to extend the test sets by adding a single `.bat` file to one of the test-set category folders.\n\nE.g. If you want to write a simple test case for \"privilege escalation\", that uses a tool named \"privesc.exe\", clone the repo and do the following:\n\n1. Add your tool to the `toolset` folder\n2. Write a new batch script `privesc-1.bat` and add it to the `./test-sets/privilege-escalation` folder\n3. Run `build_pack.bat`\n4. Add your test case to the table and test sets section in the README.md\n5. Create a pull request\n\n## Tool and File Extraction\n\nIf you script includes a tool, web shell, auxiliary or output file, place them in the folders `./toolset` or `./workfiles`. Running the build script `build_pack.bat` will include them in the encrypted archives `enc-toolset.7z` and `enc-files.7z`.\n\n### Extract a Tool\n\n```batch\n\"%ZIP%\" e -p%PASS% %TOOLARCH% -aoa -o%APTDIR% toolset\\tool.exe > NUL\n```\n\n### Extract a File\n\n```batch\n\"%ZIP%\" e -p%PASS% %FILEARCH% -aoa -o%APTDIR% workfile\\tool-output.txt > NUL\n```\n\n# Detection\n\nThe following table shows the different test cases and the expected detection results.\n\n- AV = Antivirus\n- NIDS = Network Intrusion Detection System\n- EDR = Endpoint Detection and Response\n- SM = Security Monitoring\n- CA = Compromise Assessment\n\n| Test Case                             | AV  | NIDS | EDR | SM  | CA  |\n|---------------------------------------|-----|------|-----|-----|-----|\n|
