"sslh -- A ssl/ssh multiplexer\n=============================\n\n`sslh` accepts connections on specified ports, and forwards\nthem further based on tests performed on the first data\npacket sent by the remote client.\n\nProbes for HTTP, TLS/SSL (including SNI and ALPN), SSH,\nOpenVPN, tinc, XMPP, SOCKS5, are implemented, and any other\nprotocol that can be tested using a regular expression, can\nbe recognised. A typical use case is to allow serving\nseveral services on port 443 (e.g. to connect to SSH from\ninside a corporate firewall, which almost never block port\n443) while still serving HTTPS on that port. \n\nHence `sslh` acts as a protocol demultiplexer, or a\nswitchboard. With the SNI and ALPN probe, it makes a good\nfront-end to a virtual host farm hosted behind a single IP\naddress.\n\n`sslh` has the bells and whistles expected from a mature\ndaemon: privilege and capabilities dropping, inetd support,\nsystemd support, transparent proxying,\nchroot, logging, IPv4 and IPv6, a fork-based and a\nselect-based model, and more.\n\nInstall\n=======\n\nPlease refer to the [install guide](doc/INSTALL.md).\n\n\nConfiguration\n=============\n\nPlease refer to the [configuration guide](doc/config.md).\n\n\n\nComments? Questions?\n====================\n\nYou can subscribe to the `sslh` mailing list here:\n<https://lists.rutschle.net/mailman/listinfo/sslh>\n\nThis mailing list should be used for discussion, feature\nrequests, and will be the preferred channel for announcements.\n\nOf course, check the [FAQ](doc/FAQ.md) first!\n\n"
