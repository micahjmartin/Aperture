"# Tedis\n\n![Tedis](./screen.png)\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/vvondra/tedis.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/vvondra/tedis)\n\nTedis is a beautiful, easy-to-use [Tile38](http://tile38.com/) management application built on the modern web with [Electron](https://github.com/atom/electron), [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), and [Redux](https://github.com/rackt/redux). It's powered by many awesome Node.js modules, especially [ioredis](https://github.com/luin/ioredis) and [ssh2](https://github.com/mscdex/ssh2).\n\nIt is a fork of [Medis](http://getmedis.com/), a UI for Redis. Since Tile38 supports the Redis RESP protocol, many of the features and core functionalities of Medis could be re-used and build upon. Many thanks to the original creators!\n\nTedis starts with all the basic features you need:\n\n* Keys viewing/editing\n* SSH Tunnel for connecting with remote servers\n* Terminal for executing custom commands\n* Config viewing/editing\n* Visualizing GeoJSON on a rendered map canvas\n\nIt also supports many advanced features:\n\n* Working with millions keys and key members without blocking the redis server\n* Pattern manager for easy selecting a sub group of keys.\n\n## Download Tedis\n\n*Coming soon*\n\n## Running Locally\n\n\n\n```bash\n#\u00a01.
