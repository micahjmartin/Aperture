In 2009 the WiFi Alliance actually fixed the problem (see [802.11w](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11w-2009)), but only a few companies implemented it into their devices and software.  \nTo effectively prevent a deauthentication attack, both client and access point must support the 802.11w standard with protected management frames (PMF).  \nWhile most client devices seem to support it when the access point forces it, basically no WiFi access point has it enabled.  \n\nFeel free to test your hardware out, annoy these companies with the problem, share this project and push for a fix!\nThis project is also a great way to learn more about WiFi, micro controllers, Arduino, hacking and electronics/programming in general.  \n**But please use this tool responsibly and do not use it against others without their permission!**\n\nThe difference between deauthing and jamming: [click me](https://github.com/spacehuhn/esp8266_deauther/wiki/FAQ#difference-between-jammer-and-deauther)\n\n## Official Deauther Boards\n\n![PICTURE DSTIKE Deauther OLED Board](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/spacehuhn/esp8266_deauther/img/DSTIKE_Deauther_Board.jpg)\n\nIf you want to support the development of this project, you can buy one of the official boards by DSTIKE (Travis Lin) on following sites:  \n- [Tindie](https://tindie.com/stores/lspoplove)  \n- [AliExpress](https://dstike.aliexpress.com/store/2996024)  \n- [Taobao](https://shop135375846.taobao.com)  \n\nThose boards are optimized for this project, ready to use and come preflashed with the Deauther software!  \nFor more details visit the [Wiki](https://github.com/spacehuhn/esp8266_deauther/wiki) under [Supported Devices](https://github.com/spacehuhn/esp8266_deauther/wiki/Supported-Devices).  \n\n## Disclaimer\nThis project is a proof of concept for testing and educational purposes.  \nNeither the ESP8266, nor its SDK was meant or built for such purposes. Bugs can occur!  \n\nUse it only against your own networks and devices!  \nPlease check the legal regulations in your country before using it.  \nI don't take any responsibility for what you do with this program.  \n\nIt is **not a frequency jammer** as claimed falsely by many people. Its attack, its method and how to protect against it is described above. It uses valid Wi-Fi frames described in the IEEE 802.11 standard and doesn't block or disrupt any frequencies.  \n\nThis project is meant to draw more attention on this issue.  \nThe [deauthentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi_deauthentication_attack) attack shows how vulnerable the 802.11 Wi-Fi standard is and that it has to be fixed.  \nA solution is already there, why don't we use it?\n\n**Please don't refer to this project as \"jammer\", that totally undermines the real purpose of this project!**\nIf you do, it only proves that you didn't understand anything of what this project stands for. Publishing content about this without a proper explanation shows that you only do it for the clicks, fame and/or money and have no respect for intellectual property, the community behind it and the fight for a better WiFi standard!  \n\n## Getting Started\n\nVisit our new [Wiki](https://github.com/spacehuhn/esp8266_deauther/wiki) on how to recreate this project and use it.  \nHappy Hacking!\n\n## Credits\nA huge thanks to:\n- [@deantonious](http://github.com/deantonious)\n- [@jLynx](https://github.com/jLynx)\n- [@lspoplove](https://github.com/lspoplove)\n- [@schinfo](https://github.com/schinfo)\n- [@tobozo](https://github.com/tobozo)\n- [@xdavidhu](https://github.com/xdavidhu)\n- [@PwnKitteh](https://github.com/PwnKitteh)\n\nfor helping out with various things regarding this project and keeping it alive!  \n\nI also want to thank Espressif and their community for this awesome chip and all the software and hardware projects around it and the countless tutorials you can find online!  \n\nShoutout to everyone working on the libraries used for this project:\n- [esp8266-oled-ssd1306](https://github.com/ThingPulse/esp8266-oled-ssd1306)\n- [ArduinoJson](https://github.com/bblanchon/ArduinoJson)\n- [LinkedList](https://github.com/ivanseidel/LinkedList)\n\nAlso thanks to everyone that supports this project by [donating](http://spacehuhn.de/donate), being my [patron](http://patreon.com/spacehuhn) or buying one of the [official Deauther boards](https://www.tindie.com/stores/lspoplove) from DSTIKE.  \n\n## License \n\nThis software is licensed under the MIT License.
