It allows you to train \noff-the-shelf models with minimum code: You just give your data and say which model you \nwant to train, and traintool takes care of the rest. It has **pre-implemented models** \nfor most major use cases, works with different data formats and follows best practices \nfor **experiment tracking** and **deployment**. \n\n<sup>Alpha Release: Note that traintool is in an early alpha release. The API can and will change \nwithout notice. If you find a bug, please file an issue on [Github](https://github.com/jrieke/traintool) \nor [write me](mailto:johannes.rieke@gmail.com).</sup>\n\n\n## Installation\n\n```bash\npip install git+https://github.com/jrieke/traintool\n```\n\n## Is traintool for you?\n\n**YES** if you...\n\n- need to solve standard ML tasks with standard, off-the-shelf models\n- prefer 98 % accuracy with one line of code over 98.1 % with 1000 lines\n- want to compare different model types (e.g. deep network vs. SVM)\n- care about experiment tracking & deployment\n\n\n**NO** if you...\n\n- need to customize every aspect of your model, e.g. in basic research\n- want to chase state of the art\n\n\n## Features\n\n- **Minimum coding \u2014** traintool is designed from the ground up to require as few lines of code as possible. It offers a sleek and intuitive interface that gets you started in seconds. Training a model just takes a single line:\n\n    ```python\n    traintool.train(\"resnet18\", train_data, test_data)\n    ```\n\n- **Pre-implemented models \u2014** traintool offers fully implemented and tested models \u2013 from simple classifiers to deep neural networks. The alpha version supports image classification only but we will add more models soon. Here are only a few of the models you can use:\n\n    ```python\n    \"svm\", \"random-forest\", \"alexnet\", \"resnet50\", \"inception_v3\", ...\n    ```\n\n- **Easy, yet fully customizable \u2014** You can customize every aspect of the model training and hyperparameters. Simply pass along a config dictionary:\n\n    ```python\n    traintool.train(..., config={\"optimizer\": \"adam\", \"lr\": 0.1})\n    ```\n\n- **Automatic experiment tracking \u2014** traintool automatically calculates metrics and stores them \u2013 without requiring you to write any code. You can visualize the results with tensorboard or stream directly to [comet.ml](https://www.comet.ml/).\n\n- **Automatic saving and checkpoints \u2014** traintool automatically stores model checkpoints, logs, and experiment information in an intuitive directory structure. No more worrying about where you've put that one good experiment or which configuration it had. \n\n- **Works with multiple data formats \u2014** traintool understands numpy arrays, pytorch datasets, or files and automatically converts them to the correct format for the model you train. \n\n- **Instant deployment \u2014** You can deploy your model with one line of code to a REST API that you can query from anywhere. Just call:\n\n    ```python\n    model.deploy()\n    ```\n\n- **Built on popular ML libraries \u2014** Under the hood, traintool uses common open-source frameworks like pytorch, tensorflow, and scikit-learn. You can always access the raw models from these frameworks if you want to do more complex analysis:\n\n    ```python\n    torch_model = model.raw()[\"model\"]\n    ```\n\n\n\n\n<!--\nFeatures & design principles:\n\n- **pre-implemented models** for most major use cases\n- automatic experiment tracking with **tensorboard or comet.ml**\n- instant **deployment** through REST API\n- supports multiple data formats (numpy, pytorch/tensorflow, files, ...)\n- access to raw models from sklearn/pytorch/tensorflow\n-->\n\n\n\n## Example: Image classification on MNIST\n\n```python\nimport mnist\nimport traintool\n\n# Load MNIST data as numpy arrays (also works with torch/tensorflow datasets, files, ...)\ntrain_data = [mnist.train_images(), mnist.train_labels()]\ntest_data = [mnist.test_images(), mnist.test_labels()]\n\n# Train SVM\nsvm = traintool.train(\"svm\", train_data=train_data, test_data=test_data)\n\n# Train ResNet with custom hyperparameters & track metrics to tensorboard\nconfig = {\"lr\": 0.1, \"optimizer\": \"adam\"}\nresnet = traintool.train(\"resnet\", train_data=train_data, test_data=test_data, \n                         config=config, tensorboard=True)\n\n# Make prediction\nresult = resnet.predict(test_data[0][0])\nprint(result[\"predicted_class\"])\n\n# Deploy to REST API (with fastapi)\nresnet.deploy()\n\n# Get underlying pytorch model (e.g. for custom analysis)\npytorch_model = resnet.raw()[\"model\"]\n```\n\nInterested?
