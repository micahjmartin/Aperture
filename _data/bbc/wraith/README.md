"![Wraith logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BBC-News/wraith/master/assets/wraith-logo.png)\n\n[![build status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/BBC-News/wraith.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/BBC-News/wraith)\n[![rubygems version](https://img.shields.io/gem/v/wraith.svg)](https://rubygems.org/gems/wraith)\n[![codeclimate report](https://codeclimate.com/github/BBC-News/wraith.png)](https://codeclimate.com/github/BBC-News/wraith)\n\nWraith is a screenshot comparison tool, created by developers at BBC News.\n\n[Documentation](http://bbc-news.github.io/wraith/) \u2022 [Source](http://github.com/bbc-news/wraith) \u2022 [Responsive News Website](http://responsivenews.co.uk)\n\n## What is it?\n\nWraith uses a headless browser to create screenshots of webpages on different environments (or at different moments in time) and then creates a diff of the two images; the affected areas are highlighted in blue.\n\n![Photo of BBC News with a diff](http://bbc-news.github.io/wraith/img/wraith.png)\n\n## Documentation\n\nFor instructions on how to install, set up and use Wraith and all of its features, [visit the Wraith documentation](http://bbc-news.github.io/wraith/index.html).\n\nA brief overview of how Wraith works is provided below.\n\n## Wraith modes\n\nThere are several ways in which Wraith can be used:\n\n1. Comparison of 2 domains (`wraith capture`). There are also some specialist options within this mode:\n    * Spidering 2 domains for changes (`wraith capture` when no `paths` property is provided in the configuration file)\n    * Running several comparisons at once (`wraith multi_capture`)\n2. Comparing the same domain over time (`wraith history`, then `wraith latest`)\n\nWhichever mode you decide to run Wraith in, the process it follows is generally the same:\n\n* takes screenshots of your webpages\n* runs a comparison task across them\n* outputs a diff PNG file comparing the two images, and a data.txt file which contains the percentage of pixels that have changed\n* packages all of this up into a gallery.html, ready for you to view\n* if any screenshot's diff is above the threshold you specified in your configuration file, the task exits with a system error code (useful for CI)\n* the failed screenshot will also be highlighted in the gallery\n\n## Requirements\n\n[ImageMagick](http://www.imagemagick.org/) is required to compare the screenshots and crop images.\n\nWraith also requires at least one of these headless browsers:\n\n* [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org)\n* [CasperJS](http://casperjs.org/) (which can be used to target specific selectors)\n* [SlimerJS](http://slimerjs.org)\n* [Chrome](https://askubuntu.com/questions/510056/how-to-install-google-chrome/510063) (Currently using Selenium WebDriver + Chromedriver for Chrome; Can target specific selectors)\n\n## Contributing\n\nPlease read [how to contribute to Wraith](https://github.com/BBC-News/wraith/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\n## License\n\nWraith is available to everyone under the terms of the Apache 2.0 open source license.

Selenium integration, both running locally on a desktop or on a selenium grid\n2. Browser to browser screenshot comparison\n3. Page component-based comparison\n"
