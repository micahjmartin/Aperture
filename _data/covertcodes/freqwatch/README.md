"# Freqwatch v0.2\nJoshua Davis (freqwatch -!- edgetera.net)  \n\n# UPDATE:\nThis is newer and does more: http://www.gammarf.io - check it out.  \nOr check out my SensorScape repo\n\nUpdates in v0.2\n===============\n\n* Client ID goes to database\n* Experimental GPS (not finished yet, need help testing)\n\n\nIntroduction\n============\n\n* Explore vast regions of the RF spectrum\n\n* Log radio activity to a mysql database for trend analysis\n\n* Delegate scanners to find radio traffic and log it\n\n* Delegate monitors to store interesting data in the database\n\n\nUsage\n=====\n\n* Install (see the INSTALL file)\n\n* Use the 'blacklist' file to prevent frequency ranges from showing up in\n  your database / output\n\n* Configure some sticks as scanners using freqwatch.conf.  Scanners scan\n  frequency ranges and log signals above a defined threshold to the database,\n  in the 'freqs' table.\n\n* Configure other sticks as monitors by using the modified rtl_fm included.\n  Use regular rtl_fm options to specify frequency ranges (several to scan\n  different frequencies), etc.  The output will be logged to the database\n  'intercepts' table.\n\n* See the freqwatch.conf file for examples\n\n* Use the intercept.py file in the rtl_fm_new directory to pull data from\n  the monitor database.  The monitor system still has problems (inserts\n  blanks in the output...)\n\n\nUseful Commands\n===============\n\n* Get rtl_fm_new data to listen to / decode: mysql --binary-mode -e \"select group_concat(data separator '') from intercepts order by date, time;\" -A -B -r -L -N freqwatch -u freqwatch -p > output\n\n* Or better yet, use intercept.py in the rtl_fm directory\n\n* Intercept WBFM: rtl_fm -f 95.7e6 -s 170k -A fast -r 32k -l 0 | play -r 32k -t raw -e s -b 16 -c 1 -V1 - (they suggest using -E deemp, but that doesn't work for me)\n\n* Listen to WBFM on the command line: cat file | play -t raw -r 32k -e signed-integer -b 16 -c 1 -V1 -\n\n\nSecurity Note\n==============\n\nYou should run freqwatch in a controlled environment (e.g. with the web and\ndatabase servers on localhost, and a firewall blocking the relevant ports\nfrom outsiders.)\n"
