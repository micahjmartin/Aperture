    sniffs DNS traffic and logs queries. It implements a time-based filter to narrow the scope of DNS logs for analysts to examine; if traffic to Google is typical for your environment, you won't be innundated with these query logs, but WILL get logs for malwaredomain123.xyz if that is an atypical query.
    This can be installed locally, on a resolver/forwarder, or on a machine plugged into a switchport that is mirroring ports.
