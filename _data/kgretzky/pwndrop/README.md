The backend serves REST API and manages a local database, powered by GO language.\n\n## Write-up\n\nIf you want to learn how to use **pwndrop** or you want to learn what new features were implemented in recent releases, make sure to check out the posts on my blog:\n\nhttps://breakdev.org/pwndrop\n\n## Video guide\n\nTake a look at the fantastic video made by Luke Turvey ([@TurvSec](https://twitter.com/TurvSec)), which fully explains how to get started using **pwndrop**.\n\n[![File and Phishing Payload Hosting using PwnDrop (Red Team) - Luke Turvey](https://img.youtube.com/vi/e3veSyIFvOE/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3veSyIFvOE)\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nIf you don't yet have the server to deploy to I highly recommend Digital Ocean. The cheapest $5/mo Debian 9 server with 25GB of storage space will work wonders for you. You can use my referral link to [get an extra $100 to spend on your servers in 60 days for free](https://m.do.co/c/50338abc7ffe).\n\nRegister a new domain and point its DNS A records to your VPS IP. You can also register a domain and point its `ns1` and `ns2` nameservers to **pwndrop** instance IP - it will automatically respond with valid DNS A replies.\n\n1. Registered domain name pointing to **pwndrop** instance IP as a DNS A records or as a nameserver.\n2. Server with at least 512 MB RAM.\n\nIf you want to set up **pwndrop** without a domain, check below how to set up a local instance, which will not auto-generate HTTPS certificates.\n\n## Installation\n\nMake sure there aren't any DNS or HTTP(S) servers running before you attempt to install **pwndrop**.\n\n#### Oneliner\n\nI do not recommend running oneliners, before downloading and checking the script code, but if you are really in a hurry, here it is:\n```\ncurl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kgretzky/pwndrop/master/install_linux.sh | sudo bash\n```\n\nThis will download the latest amd64 release binary and fully install a daemon running in a background.\n\n#### From binary\n\nFirst you need to download the release package you want from: https://github.com/kgretzky/pwndrop/releases\n\nThen do the following (this performs same actions to the oneliner):\n\n```\ntar zxvf pwndrop-linux-amd64.tar.gz\n./pwndrop stop\n./pwndrop install\n./pwndrop start\n./pwndrop status\n```\n\n#### From source code\n\nFirst of all, make sure you have installed GO with version at least **1.13**: https://golang.org/doc/install\n\nThen do the following:\n\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/kgretzky/pwndrop\ncd pwndrop\nmake\nmake install\n```\n\n## Quickstart\n\nMake sure the **pwndrop** is running.\n\n1. Open the secret URL to authorize your browser: `https://yourdomain.com/pwndrop` (this is a default value; make sure to use the secret path, you've pre-configured)\n2. Open the admin panel URL in your browser: `https://yourdomain.com/` (since you've authorized your browser, you will now see an admin panel login page)\n3. Create your admin account or login.\n4. Click the configuration cog in top-left corner and make sure you change the secret path to something other than `/pwndrop`.\n\nYou're good to go!\n\n## Running from CLI\n\nYou don't have to install **pwndrop** as a daemon and you can run it straight from the console.\n\n```\nusage: pwndrop [start|stop|install|remove|status] [-config <config_path>] [-debug] [-no-autocert] [-no-dns] [-h]\n\ndaemon management:\n    start           : start the daemon\n    stop            : stop the daemon\n    install         : install the daemon using the available system manager (systemd, systemv and upstart supported)\n    remove          : uninstall the daemon\n    status          : check status of the installed daemon\n\nparameters:\n    -config         : specify a custom path to a config file (def. 'pwndrop.ini' in same directory as the executable)\n    -debug          : enable debug output \n    -no-autocert    : disable automatic TLS certificate retrieval from LetsEncrypt; useful when you want to connect over IP or/and in a local network\n    -no-dns         : do not run a DNS server on port 53 UDP; use this if you don't want to use pwndrop as a nameserver\n    -h              : usage help\n```\n\n## Configuration\n\nOn first launch, **pwndrop**, by default, will create a new configuration file `pwndrop.ini` in the same directory as an executable. You can later modify it or supply your own, for example to pre-configure **pwndrop** before the installation to automate the deployment of a tool even better.\n\nHere is an example config file with all available config variables with commentary:\n```\n[pwndrop]\nlisten_ip = \"190.33.86.22\"                  # the external IP of your pwndrop instance (must be set if you want to use the nameserver feature)\nhttp_port = 80                              # listening port for HTTP and WebDAV\nhttps_port = 443                            # listening port for HTTPS\ndata_dir = \"./data\"                         # directory path where data storage will reside (relative paths are from executable directory path)\nadmin_dir = \"./admin\"                       # directory path where the admin panel files reside (relative paths are from executable directory path)\n\n[setup]                                     # optional: put in if you want to pre-configure pwndrop (section will be deleted from the config file on first run)\nusername = \"admin\"                          # username of the admin account\npassword = \"secretpassword\"                 # password of the admin account\nredirect_url = \"https://www.somedomain.com\" # URL to which visitors will be redirected to if they supply a path, which doesn't point to any shared file (put blank if you want to return 404)\nsecret_path = \"/pwndrop\"                    # secret URL path, which upon visiting will allow your browser to access the login page of the admin panel (make sure to change the default value)\n```\n\nIf you want to pre-configure your **pwndrop** instance before deployment using any of the installation scripts, put your configuration file at `/usr/local/pwndrop/pwndrop.ini` and it will be parsed the moment **pwndrop** daemon is first executed.\n\n## Credits\n\nHuge thanks to [**@jaredhaight**](https://twitter.com/jaredhaight) for inspiring me to learn Vue, with his [Faction C2](https://www.factionc2.com/) framework!\n\nAlso much thanks to all the people who gave me pre-release feedback and supported me with their opinions on the tool!\n\n## License\n\n**pwndrop** is made by Kuba Gretzky ([@mrgretzky](https://twitter.com/mrgretzky)) and it's released under GPL3 license.\n"
