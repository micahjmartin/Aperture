"<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/AT71SBq.png\" width=\"346\" />\n\n> Hetty is an HTTP toolkit for security research. It aims to become an open source\n> alternative to commercial software like Burp Suite Pro, with powerful features\n> tailored to the needs of the infosec and bug bounty community.\n\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/ZZ6o83X.png\">\n\n## Features/to do\n\n- [x] HTTP man-in-the-middle (MITM) proxy and GraphQL server.\n- [x] Web interface (Next.js) with proxy log viewer.\n- [ ] Add scope support to the proxy.\n- [ ] Full text search (with regex) in proxy log viewer.\n- [ ] Project management.\n- [ ] Sender module for sending manual HTTP requests, either from scratch or based\n      off requests from the proxy log.\n- [ ] Attacker module for automated sending of HTTP requests. Leverage the concurrency\n      features of Go and its `net/http` package to make it blazingly fast.\n\n## Installation\n\nHetty is packaged on GitHub as a single binary, with the web interface resources\nembedded.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 You can find downloads for Linux, macOS and Windows on the [releases page](https://github.com/dstotijn/hetty/releases).\n\n### Alternatives:\n\n**Build from source**\n\n```\n$ GO111MODULE=auto go get -u -v github.com/dstotijn/hetty/cmd/hetty\n```\n\nThen export the Next.js frontend app:\n\n```\n$ cd admin\n$ yarn install\n$ yarn export\n```\n\nThis will ensure a folder `./admin/dist` exists.\nThen, you can bundle the frontend app using `rice`.\nThe easiest way to do this is via a supplied `Makefile` command in the root of\nthe project:\n\n```\nmake build\n```\n\n**Docker**\n\nAlternatively, you can run Hetty via Docker. See: [`dstotijn/hetty`](https://hub.docker.com/r/dstotijn/hetty)\non Docker Hub.\n\n```\n$ docker run \\\n-v $HOME/.hetty/hetty_key.pem:/root/.hetty/hetty_key.pem \\\n-v $HOME/.hetty/hetty_cert.pem:/root/.hetty/hetty_cert.pem \\\n-v $HOME/.hetty/hetty.bolt:/root/.hetty/hetty.bolt \\\n-p 127.0.0.1:8080:8080 \\\ndstotijn/hetty\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nHetty is packaged as a single binary, with the web interface resources embedded.\nWhen the program is run, it listens by default on `:8080` and is accessible via\nhttp://localhost:8080. Depending on incoming HTTP requests, it either acts as a\nMITM proxy, or it serves the GraphQL API and web interface (Next.js).\n\n```\n$ hetty -h\nUsage of ./hetty:\n  -addr string\n        TCP address to listen on, in the form \"host:port\" (default \":8080\")\n  -adminPath string\n        File path to admin build\n  -cert string\n        CA certificate filepath. Creates a new CA certificate is file doesn't exist (default \"~/.hetty/hetty_cert.pem\")\n  -db string\n        Database file path (default \"~/.hetty/hetty.bolt\")\n  -key string\n        CA private key filepath. Creates a new CA private key if file doesn't exist (default \"~/.hetty/hetty_key.pem\")\n```\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f _Todo: Write instructions for installing CA certificate in local CA store, and_\n_configuring Hetty to be used as a proxy server._\n\n## Vision and roadmap\n\nThe project has just gotten underway, and as such I haven\u2019t had time yet to do a\nwrite-up on its mission and roadmap. A short summary/braindump:\n\n- Fast core/engine, built with Go, with a minimal memory footprint.\n- GraphQL server to interact with the backend.\n- Easy to use web interface, built with Next.js and Material UI.\n- Extensibility is top of mind. All modules are written as Go packages, to\n  be used by the main `hetty` program, but also usable as libraries for other software.\n  Aside from the GraphQL server, it should (eventually) be possible to also use\n  it as a CLI tool.\n- Pluggable architecture for the MITM proxy and future modules, making it\n  possible for hook into the core engine.\n- I\u2019ve chosen [Cayley](https://cayley.io/) as the graph database (backed by\n  BoltDB storage on disk) for now (not sure if it will work in the long run).\n  The benefit is that Cayley (also written in Go)\n  is embedded as a library. Because of this, the complete application is self contained\n  in a single running binary.\n- Talk to the community, and focus on the features that the majority.\n  Less features means less code to maintain.\n\n## Status\n\nThe project is currently under active development. Please star/follow and check\nback soon. \ud83e\udd17\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nThanks to the [Hacker101 community on Discord](https://www.hacker101.com/discord)\nfor all the encouragement to actually start building this thing!\n\n## License\n\n[MIT](LICENSE)\n\n---\n\n\u00a9 2020 David Stotijn \u2014 [Twitter](https://twitter.com/dstotijn), [Email](mailto:dstotijn@gmail.com)\n"
