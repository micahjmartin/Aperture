description: An open source real-time network topology and protocols analyzer
writeup: Skydive is an open source real-time network topology and protocols analyzer.
  It aims to provide a comprehensive way of understanding what is happening in the
  network infrastructure. Skydive agents collect topology information and flows and
  forward them to a central agent for further analysis. All the information is stored
  in an Elasticsearch database. Skydive is SDN-agnostic but provides SDN drivers in
  order to enhance the topology and flows information.
