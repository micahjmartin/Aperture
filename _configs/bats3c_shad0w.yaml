description: A post exploitation framework designed to operate covertly on heavily
  monitored environments
writeup: SHAD0W is a modular C2 framework designed to successfully operate on mature
  environments. Supports JSON Based Protocol - Custom beaons are able to built and
  used easily with an easy to implement protocol It will use a range of methods to
  evade EDR and AV while allowing the operator to continue using tooling an tradecraft
  they are familiar with. Its powered by Python 3.8 and C, using Donut for payload
  generation. By using Donut along side the process injection capabilities of SHAD0W
  it gives the operator the ability to execute .NET assemblies, EXEs, DLLs, VBS, JS
  or XSLs fully inside memory. Dynamically resolved syscalls are heavily used to avoid
  userland API hooking, anti DLL injection to make it harder for EDR to load code
  into the beacons and offical microsoft mitigation methods to protect spawn processes.
