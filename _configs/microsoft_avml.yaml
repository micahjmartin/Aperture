description: AVML - Acquire Volatile Memory for Linux
writeup: AVML is an X86_64 userland volatile memory acquisition tool written in Rust,
  intended to be deployed as a static binary. AVML can be used to acquire memory without
  knowing the target OS distribution or kernel a priori. No on-target compilation
  or fingerprinting is needed.
