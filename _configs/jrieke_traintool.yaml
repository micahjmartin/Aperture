description: "\U0001F527 Train off-the-shelf machine learning models with one line\
  \ of code"
writeup: 'traintool is a Python library for applied machine learning. It allows you
  to train off-the-shelf models with minimum code: You just give your data and say
  which model you want to train, and traintool takes care of the rest. It has pre-implemented
  models for most major use cases, works with different data formats and follows best
  practices for experiment tracking and deployment.'
