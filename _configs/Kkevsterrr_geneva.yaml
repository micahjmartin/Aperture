description: automated censorship evasion for the client-side and server-side
writeup: 'Geneva is an artificial intelligence tool that defeats censorship by exploiting
  bugs in censors, such as those in China, India, and Kazakhstan. Unlike many other
  anti-censorship solutions which require assistance from outside the censoring regime
  (Tor, VPNs, etc.), Geneva runs strictly on one side of the connection (either the
  client or server side).

  Under the hood, Geneva uses a genetic algorithm to evolve censorship evasion strategies
  and has found several previously unknown bugs in censors. Geneva''s strategies manipulate
  the network stream to confuse the censor without impacting the client/server communication.
  This makes Geneva effective against many types of in-network censorship (though
  it cannot be used against IP-blocking censorship).'
