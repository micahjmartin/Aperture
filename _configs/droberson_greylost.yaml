description: DNS logging, detection, ...
writeup: sniffs DNS traffic and logs queries. It implements a time-based filter to
  narrow the scope of DNS logs for analysts to examine; if traffic to Google is typical
  for your environment, you won't be innundated with these query logs, but WILL get
  logs for malwaredomain123.xyz if that is an atypical query. This can be installed
  locally, on a resolver/forwarder, or on a machine plugged into a switchport that
  is mirroring ports.
