description: Crack and decrypt BLE encryption
writeup: crackle cracks BLE Encryption (AKA Bluetooth Smart). crackle exploits a flaw
  in the BLE pairing process that allows an attacker to guess or very quickly brute
  force the TK (Temporary Key). With the TK and other data collected from the pairing
  process, the STK (Short Term Key) and later the LTK (Long Term Key) can be collected.
  With the STK and LTK, all communications between the master and the slave can be
  decrypted.
