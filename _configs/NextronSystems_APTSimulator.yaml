description: A toolset to make a system look as if it was the victim of an APT attack
writeup: APT Simulator is a Windows Batch script that uses a set of tools and output
  files to make a system look as if it was compromised. In contrast to other adversary
  simulation tools, APT Simulator is designed to make the application as simple as
  possible. You don't need to run a web server, database or any agents on set of virtual
  machines. Just download the prepared archive, extract and run the contained Batch
  file as Administrator.
