description: 'Cortex: a Powerful Observable Analysis and Active Response Engine'
writeup: 'Cortex tries to solve a common problem frequently encountered by SOCs, CSIRTs
  and security researchers  in the course of threat intelligence, digital forensics
  and incident response: how to analyze observables they have collected, at scale,
  by querying a single tool instead of several?'
